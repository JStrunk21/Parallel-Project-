                                               Parallel Project Part 1

For this project we built a system that lets computers communicate with each other by wired and wireless networks. Our work involved using java code to create a setup where every computer can act as both the sender and the receiver, imitating real world networking scenarios. For our project we started with four pieces of java code designed to connect computers in a way that they could send text and audio files to each other. We tested this setup on 3 different computers in a controlled environment to make sure it could handle real data transmission tasks efficiently. Testing the codes to make sure they work was a big part of our project. We used resources like IntelliJ and GitHub Codespaces to run our system in different scenarios. With this approach it helped us see how our network performed in real time and allowed us to adjust for better performance. With our project we focused on key aspects such as how fast the system could send and receive data, how well it manages different types of files, and how it determined the best routes for data to travel. Our findings showed us that our system could effectively handle network tasks, proving our design and implementation strategies were effective. Our project not only taught us about networking but also showed us that building a completely functional communication system from scratch is achievable if you know how to code and if you have the right tools and a clear understanding of the basics
