Two ways to test the code
1. Using InteliJ, JGrasp, etc.
   - Must be done on 3 different computers unless these is a way to run 3 files simultaneously.
   - run ServerRouter first, then run TCPClient and TCPServer
   - Make the file.txt is in the same directory as TCPClient(in the project file)
   - Once the ServerRouter runs it should say "listening on port" and followed by the port number
   - The client and server will then communicate and display the message that was written in file.txt
2. Using Github Codespace(its free if you connect ur KSU account)
   - on codespace you can run all 3 files at once its much easier in my opinion.
   - Steps to run are the same as above
